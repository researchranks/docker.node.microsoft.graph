# graph-service

A service for accessing the Microsoft Graph API.

Version 1.0.9

Exports the GraphService class. This class is subclassed from the `HttpsService` class (see [https-service](https://github.com/fhellwig/https-service)) and uses the `ClientCredentials` class (see [client-credentials](https://github.com/fhellwig/client-credentials)).

## 1. Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save graph-service
```

## 2. Usage

```javascript
const GraphService = require('graph-service');

const api = new GraphService('my-company.com', 'client-id', 'client-secret');

api.get('/v1.0/users', (err, users) => {
    console.log(users);
});
```

### 2.1 Endpoints

By default, this utility uses the `https://graph.microsoft.com` endpoint. You can specify the older `https://graph.windows.net` endpoint by adding a version number as the last argument in the constructor:

```javascript
const api = new GraphService('my-company.com', 'client-id', 'client-secret', '1.6');
```

This will use the older endpoint and add the `api-version` query parameter to all paths.

## 3. API

Since the `GraphService` class subclasses the [HttpsService](https://github.com/fhellwig/https-service) class, the API is identical as for that class, with three exceptions. First, the constructor accepts the same arguments as the [ClientCredentials](https://github.com/fhellwig/client-credentials) class. Second, there is an additional `authorizedRequest` method that accepts a token provided by the client instead of using the client credentials created in the constructor. Third, the `all` method performs repeated `GET` requests, accumulating the results.

### 3.1 constructor

```javascript
GraphService([tenant, clientId, clientSecret])
```

Creates a new `GraphService` instance for the specified `tenant`. The `clientId` and the `clientSecret` must be for an AAD application that has access rights to the Microsoft Graph resource (`https://graph.microsoft.com`). These three parameters are optional. If you have your own token, and wish to only call the `me` API resources, then you can call the constructor with no arguments. In that case, you must use the `authorizedRequest` method instead of the `request` method, passing in your own access token as the first parameter.

### 3.2 authorizedRequest

```javascript
authorizedRequest(token, method, path, headers, data, callback)
```

Sets the `Authorization` header with the bearer token and then calls the `request` method.

### 3.3 all

```javascript
all(path, [query,], callback)
```

Sends repeated `GET` requests to a resource that returns a list. This method accumulates the results from the `value` property and follows the `@odata.nextLink` property.
